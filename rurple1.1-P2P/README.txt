# README for the RUR-PLE changes made by UMBC Playing to Program Group.

Configuring the Environment

After downloading the Rurple files and entering the Home directory for the
application there will be a file that was not in the original Rurple framework,
move.sh. Run this program to move world files to the .config directory. This
is a temporary fix for moving files and is currently only possible on UNIX
based systems, with changes forth coming.

To run RUR-PLE you run python rur_start.py. This may generate errors if your
configuration is not set up correctly. Consult the man pages and you may have
to change the environment variable VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION using
export VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION=2.5. If you are runnig in 64-bit mode you
will also have to make the necessary environment change to the prefer-32-bit
variable.



Using the System

Once the P2P system is running you are greeted by a screen that allows for the
creation of a new user or to continue as a returning user. A new user is 
required to enter various demographic information before being granted acces.
Returning users must simply re-eneter their GL names. Information for users is
stored in the users $HOME directory's .config folder. The full file path is
$HOME/.config/rurple/StudentFiles.

This Folder contains three (3) subfolders. The Demographics subfolder contains
each users saved demographic information. The file names are in the format 
id_demo, with the id being a randomly generated key that is unique for each
user and used to identify them anomously. The Source Code folder contains
the users source code for each problem. The filename is of the format
id_code_problemNumber. The Worlds folder contains the world that the user
operated on for the associated code file. The world files are stored in the
format id_world_problemNumber.

When using the system the user is presented with an instruction panel in the
initial window. This panel acts as a reference to common functions for the
student. The Code and Learn tab is where the user interacts witht he system.
The user must press the green start button to begin the program. The program
will then present an instruction panel for the user in a separate window.
The user must solve the problem, following the instructions given on the panel.
To submit their answer the student must select the green checkmark on the
top left of the application. This saves the users work to the previously
mentioned folders. It then automatically moves to the next problem randomly
generated by the application. After a designated number of problems, the user
is prompted that they have completed the problems and they are logged out and
the application exits.

Bugs being addressed: 
      An error occurs on logout.

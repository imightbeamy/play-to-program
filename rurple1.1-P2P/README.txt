# README for the RUR-PLE changes made by UMBC Playing to Program Group.

After downloading the Rurple files and entering the Home directory for the
application there will be a file that was not in the original Rurple framework,
move.sh. Run this program to move world files to the .config directory. This
is a temporary fix for moving files and is currently only possible on UNIX
based systems, with changes forth coming.

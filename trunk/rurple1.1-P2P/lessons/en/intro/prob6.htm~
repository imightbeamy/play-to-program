<h3 class="suggested">Weeding and seeding time</h3>

<p>It is spring time again. Reeborg's father has seeded the garden for the
fall harvest. Just like last time, in some places, two seeds have sprouted
whereas in others none have. A typical situation is shown below (file:
harvest4.wld).</p>

<p><img alt="weeding" src="../../images/intro/harvest4.png" /></p>

<p>Help Reeborg weed the garden, so that there are no places with two carrots
(beepers), and reseed so that there are no places with none.</p>

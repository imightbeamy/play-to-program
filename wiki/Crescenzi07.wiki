This group uses nearly the same taxonomy as [AlBarakati09 this paper] for student engagement with algorithms: No Viewing, Viewing, Changing, Constructing, and Presenting. They eliminated responding (i.e. to questions) from the engagement taxonomy.
They used a tool called Alvie that is an anthropomorphised algorithm visualisation environment, that runs through pseudocode illustrating what is happening. According to the authors, the students enjoyed the activities and, in a survey, said they helped. I'm not certain that very much of interest to the game was in this paper, unless it gets much more sophisticated tools. EF

DJW adds, they used the Alvie tool in a data structures course and asked students to view, change, create, and present data-structure algorithm visualizations.  The course has an associated textbook that refers to the tool and the visualizations.

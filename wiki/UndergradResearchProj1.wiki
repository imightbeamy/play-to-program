#summary Notes about the undergraduate research project, creating a Bayesian student model

===Student model===

Relevant papers:

[Mitrovic01 Optimising ITS Behaviour with Bayesian Networks and Decision Theory] -- student model based on Bayesian Networks where structure and probabilities of the network are learned from data

===Domain model===

Relevant papers:

[Ma09 Improving the mental models held by novice programmers using cognitive conflict and jeliot visualisations] -- Paper contains a concept map that is used by their tool

[Butz06 A Web-based Bayesian Intelligent Tutoring System for Computer Programming] -- appendix includes a DAG of intro CS concepts with prerequisite dependencies

[Guzman07 Adaptive testing for hierarchical student models] -- sophisticated system for building a model of student knowledge, advocates for using a tree for the concept map rather than a DAG

[Kumar06 Using Enhanced Concept Map for Student Modeling in a Model-Based Programming Tutor] -- concept map-based student model with concepts and learning objectives

[Goldman08 Identifying important and difficult concepts in introductory computing courses using a delphi process] -- list of difficult and important intro CS concepts

[Yoo06 Intelligent Tutoring System for CS-I and II Laboratory] -- ITS shows a tree of concepts to the user

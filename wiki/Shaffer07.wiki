SUMMARY: A nice overview of many different approaches to visualization, and their effectiveness in improving programming performance. This seems like a useful paper that we should all look at.

    * most visualizations aren't actually that useful
    * visualizations can help in teaching programming, but that doesn't mean they always do
    * they looked at over 350 visualizations
    * the visualizations they studied are focused on a particular data structure (e.g., splay trees) or algorithm (e.g., quicksort) (as opposed to general tools for visualizing any algorithm)
    * most of the tools "have no pedagogical value" - i.e., they don't give any actual insight into the algorithm. "Even the better visualizations tend to have serious deficiencies."
    * Most of them are animations where the user can't control the visualization (e.g., pause, rewind); or the data being operated on -- DJW
    * in many cases, only the results of operations are shown, without showing the process (e.g., of a tree insertion)
    * most of the visualizations are 10-15 years old; not as many visualizations are being produced any more
    * no single/common repository exists (though they mention a couple that could perhaps grow and become more mature - CITIDEL and the JERIC/ACM DL)
    * they also mention that it'd be better if visualizations came with courseware that described how to use them in pedagogically effective ways, and list a few courseware sites (which they say aren't well known in the CS community) -- DJW
    * they say there appears to be progress in research into how to make effective visualizations, now more people just need to be educated in the techniques and tools for creating them -- DJW

They did a survey on different types of students and how they use visualizations and how much they learned from the visualizations.
The results seemed pretty interesting. Students seemed to use visualizations the most when studying on their own, but found them more useful when a teacher explained them. They also found that students with no prior programming experience had more difficulty understanding visualizations.

DJW adds, this study supports the findings of other studies that students get more out of visualizations when they are engaged with them and when they understand what they are being shown.  They claim that simple interactive UIs are the most promising and effective.
